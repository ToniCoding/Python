# PyGame-Tutorials
Some PyGame tutorials made by me that helped me to understand better and easily PyGame and the possibilities you have to develop with it! 

Coding with PyGame is fun when you start understanding everything. You can make really good games with it, using the module and your knowledge in Python language.
As some things can be really hard to understand at first for a begginer (I'm a begginer myself) I decided to make this guides. =)
