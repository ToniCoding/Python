"""
This module defines the class `FileHandler` which provides methods for file operations.

Dependencies:
- `Enum` from `enum` for defining file operation modes.
- `contextmanager` from `contextlib` for managing file resources.
- `Generator`, `IO` from `typing` for type hinting.
- `isfile` from `os.path` for checking file existence.
- `Logger` from `tools.logger` for logging.

Class:
    FileHandler: Class that provides methods for file operations.

Methods:
    __init__(self, operating_mode: str) -> None:
        Initializes the `FileHandler` class with an operating mode.

    set_operating_mode(self, new_operating_mode: str) -> None:
        Sets a new operating mode.

    get_operating_mode(self) -> FileOperatingMode:
        Returns the current operating mode.

    open_file(self, path: str, mode: str) -> Generator[IO, None, None]:
        Opens a file with resource management.

    write_file(self, path: str, content: str) -> bool:
        Appends content to a file.

    read_file(self, path: str) -> str | None:
        Reads a file and returns the content.

    operate_file(self, path: str, content: str = "") -> bool:
        Performs file operations based on the current mode.
